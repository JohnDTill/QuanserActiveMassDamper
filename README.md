# QuanserActiveMassDamper
This repo contains Simulink files to control Quanser's active mass damper (AMD).
The AMD system has a platform held aloft by two upright flexible plates.
Controlling the movement of a cart on top of the platform can damp the vibration
of the platform due to any disturbances at the base. This is the basic principle
for some earthquake protection devices in skyscrapers.
